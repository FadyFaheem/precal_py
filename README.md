# precal_py
My way of cheating, but coding it.

This was my roadmap into learning how to code in python but also cheating in precalcus.

Unit 7 and forth should be able to run on the new TI-84 CE.

to fight against cheating, you must wipe all RAM to make this feasable.

Yes. I exposed the way to stop it because I felt like it.

Why did I start this project?
I got lazy on my math homework, this was just "faster"

Is this stupid?
Yes.
