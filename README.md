# precal_py
_**My way of cheating, but coding it.**_

This was also my roadmap into learning how to code in python but also cheating in precalcus.

Unit 7 and forth should be able to run on the new TI-84 CE. **To fight against cheating, you must wipe all RAM to make this useless.**

Yes. I exposed the way to stop it because I felt like it.


## Why did I start this project?

I got lazy on my math homework, this was just "faster"


###### Is this stupid?
Yes.


## Sincerity to:

**Powell** my comp sci teacher. I know my code sucks. Leave me alone.

**Ross** my precal teacher. Sue me.
